# 📸 Images Setup Guide

This guide will help you add screenshots to make your README more attractive!

## Quick Setup

1. **Take Screenshots** of your application:
   - Logo (if you have one)
   - Homepage/landing page
   - Image upload interface
   - Results page showing predictions
   - Chatbot interaction

2. **Save Images** to `skin_analyzer/images/` with these exact names:
   - `logo.png` - Your project logo
   - `homepage.png` - Homepage screenshot
   - `upload.png` - Upload interface screenshot
   - `results.png` - Results page screenshot
   - `chatbot.png` - Chatbot interaction screenshot

3. **Image Tips**:
   - Use PNG format for best quality
   - Recommended size: 1200x800px for screenshots
   - Keep file sizes reasonable (< 1MB each)
   - Use clear, high-quality screenshots

## Alternative: Using Image URLs

If you prefer to host images elsewhere (GitHub releases, imgur, etc.), you can update the image paths in `README.md`:

```markdown
![Homepage](https://your-image-url.com/homepage.png)
```

## Current Status

The README is already set up with image placeholders. Once you add the images to the `images/` folder, they will automatically appear in the README!
